~~~| What is REACT? |~~~
--------------------- */

//React is a JavaScript library that helps with building user interfaces. This library breaks the web app up into components making for easier readability and editing.



/*----------------------
~~~| How does JSX work? |~~~
------------------------- */

//A basic unit of JSX is called a JSX element. JSX elements look exactly like HTML, the only difference is that you would find it in a JavaScript file.
//JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript, written to be used with React. When a JS file contains JSX code, that file will have to be compiled.
//A JSX compilar will translate any JSX into regular JS before reaching the web browser.
//JSX elements are treated as JS expressions - hence JSX can be stored in a variable, array, or object & passed to a function.

//EXAMPLES:

//   <p>This is a paragraph</p>

//   const nav = <nav>This is a navigation bar</nav>
