~~~| What is a RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT? |~~~
------------------------------------- */

//Runtime environments are where your program(s) are to be executed.
//Which runtime environment your program runs on determines what GLOBAL OBJECTS your program can access.
//In general, JavaScript is typically seen running on two runtime environments:
// 1. BROWSER: includes Chrome, Firefox, & the eventually out-of-service Internet Explorer.
// 2. NODE: A runtime environment that is separate from the browser.

//Applications created for & executed in the browser are typically referred to as front-end applications.
//Browsers usually have global objects such as `window` and can be accessed through your written JS programming.



/*-----------------------------------------
~~~| What is the NODE RUNTIME ENVIRONMENT? |~~~
-------------------------------------------- */

//Node, created in 2009, allowed programmers to develop apps that no longer relied on a browser.
//Node gives access to global objects such as `process` which contains data related to a JavaScript file being executed.
//Applications designed for the Node are usually back-end applications OR full-stack (front & back end) applications.
//Back-end applications have access to file systems, databases, & networks attached to a server.
